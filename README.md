# cslider

This is the same parallax content slider from [this codrops article](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2012/03/15/parallax-content-slider-with-css3-and-jquery/)
with the jQuery dependency removed. It works on IE10+ and modern browsers.

## Usage

See the original article.

## (Possible) TODO

* Make it work on IE9 and more mobile browsers (with the fallback styles)
* Cleaning and refactoring (likely using ES2015)
* A few additional options
